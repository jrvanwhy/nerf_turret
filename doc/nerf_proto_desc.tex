	\maketitle

	This document describes the various commands supported by this project's NXT firmware.
	It server as documentation of the interface between the NXT and the control computer used to control the Nerf turret.

	\section{Miscellaneous}
	\textbf{Mailbox:} All commands from the control computer to the NXT should be sent to the first mailbox (0 or 1, depending on if you're using 0 or 1-based indexing).
	The same is true for responses from the NXT (although there is technically a distinction between the incoming and outgoing mailboxes, which will hopefully
	be hidden by the interface library).

	\noindent
	\textbf{Program Name:} The program name (for remotely starting the program) is: \texttt{nerf.rxe}
