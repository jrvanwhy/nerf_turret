	\section{RCX}
	The motor which pulls the ``accelerator'' (spins up the flywheels) should be plugged into port A.
	The motor which pulls the trigger should be connected to port C.
	Both sets of connections should face ``downwards'' (or ``backwards'') relative to the RCX/Nerf gun, such that the floss is pulled over the top of the winch reels
	when the motors activate (in other words, the winches rotate ``backwards'' relative to the nerf gun).

	The light sensor should be connected to port 1.

	\section{NXT}
	The elevation control motor should be wired to port A.
	The left pan motor should be connected to port B and the right pan motor should be connected to port C.
	In total, when the turret is pointing ``forward'', the motors (from left to right) should be connected to ports A, B, and C, respectively.

	The touch sensor for elevation calibration should be connected to sensor port 1.

	The light sensor should be connected to sensor port 4.
	This has a reason: a light sensor connected to ports 1-3 will flash when the NXT is powered on, which will send a signal to the RCX program to activate the winch motors.
	Port 4 does not have this issue.
